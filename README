The Doodle Editor is a Mootools and PHP based WYSIWYG web page authoring tool.

Server Stuff:

I use Nginx as my testbed and rewrite URLs as follows:

                rewrite ^/public_assets/(.*)$ /public_assets/$1 break;
                rewrite ^/(.+)\.php$ /$1.php break;
                rewrite ^/([a-zA-Z0-9\/]+)$ /ajax_test.php?p=$1 break;
